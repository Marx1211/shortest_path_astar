# shortest_path_astar
Implementation of the A* algorithm in python for a weighted directed graph imported from a .cav file. 
To run the program open a terminal and type:
```
python shortest_path.py <filename>.cav
```
The code won't show anything, but it will output a .csn file with the shortest path found in the following format:
```
1 2 5 8 3 9 14 28 30
```
Where each number is a node from the graph.

Some cav files where uploaded accidentally with the code, so feel free to use them to try it out.

## Future updates
Currently the code works only for the very specific purpose of completing the coursework, but I will further tweak it so it can be easily reused for other projects.
